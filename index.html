                <p> 
                    <span>
                        &emsp; Happy Valentine’s Day, mi hermosa chica. I don’t even know where to start because there are a million things I love about you. Every single day, you make me feel like the luckiest person alive, and I can’t help but wonder how I got so lucky to have you.
                    </span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp; I feel safe when I’m around you, like nothing in the world can go wrong. You’re so caring, so thoughtful, and you always make me feel understood in a way no one else ever has. Your voice alone is enough to calm me down, and your laugh it's the cutest sound in the world. I could listen to it forever. In fact, your voice is my favorite sound.
                    </span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp; You make me feel loved in a way I never thought was possible. Every single thing about you, from your patience with me to the way you always listen, inspires me to be better. You’re strong, brave, and even when life gets tough, you keep pushing forward, and I admire that so much about you. You make every ordinary moment feel special, just by being you.
                    </span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp; Your eyes? The most beautiful I’ve ever seen I could look at them forever. Your smile? The warmest, most comforting thing in the world. And don’t get me started on your laugh because every time I hear it, I can’t help but smile like an idiot. You are beautiful, inside and out, no matter how many times you try to deny it.
                    </span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp; You are my happiness, my safe place, my home, even from miles away. The way you reassure me when I overthink, the way you listen without judgment, the way you remember the little things I say it all makes me love you even more. You’re the first person I think about when I wake up and the last person on my mind before I sleep.
                    </span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp; I miss you every second we’re apart, but somehow, you make long-distance feel a little less hard. Even just hearing your heartbeat, your voice, or seeing a random picture of you makes my entire day better. You make my life better. You make *me* better.
                    </span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp; If my younger self knew that I’d get to love someone as amazing as you, he wouldn’t believe it because he was stupid. But now, I know for sure: you’re everything I’ve ever wanted, and I’d use up a lifetime of luck just to have you.
                    </span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp; So, happy Valentine’s Day, my love. Thank you for being the most wonderful part of my life. I love you more than words can ever say.
